# MaxImage
iOS Application that pulls free _stock_ images from different web sources.

## Interface
The application tries to be as simple as it can be. On opening, the app shows a list of randomly fetched images from different sources and list can go on forever.

## Demo
This is how (somewhat) the app is gonna look once finished.
